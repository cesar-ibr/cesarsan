# The Craftsman and the Source Code
When you start programming you immediately know if programming is for you or not.
It happened to me. I wanted to build a website using code after I did it with Flash.
The more I discovered, the more I liked it. The instant gratification you get when you
code and see the result is similar to the gratification kids get when they play with Legos,
or video games. I've experienced different emotions towards programming over the years. At
the beginning everything was fun, everything was new, and there was a lot of cool things to be
discovered. My dream was to get a job doing the thing I most enjoyed, programming.

*"If I become a good programmer I will earn good money"* that's what I told myself.
Surprisingly I got a job as a programmer after three years of studying computer science. I come
from a poor and dysfunctional family in Mexico, getting money was always the top priority, so
I accepted the job. I started working at Accenture Technology Mexico in 2018 until 2020.
During those years I got experience on real world software, I learned from good programmers
and I got the most stressful time in my career. I realized how difficult is to
build good software. I lost the joy in programming, I remember me programming day and night while
getting *high* to keep stress "under control". This is not only related to software development
but to many other professions where responsibilities and obligations strictly attached to the job
kill the joy and self-realization that work should produce in our lives.

After a deep personal crisis, I understood that my problem was not with programming but with the
managing work culture some companies in the industry have. I've come to see the difference
between crafting code and programming as a job. I enjoy (again) learning about programming languages,
compilers and web development. At the same time, doing my job doesn't kill my inspiration and creativity.

This is one part of me, the developer or software engineer as the industry label us. But I'm also
the hacker, the craftsman who takes pleasure at building programs in a constant human-computer interaction.
